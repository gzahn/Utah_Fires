# Utah_Fires

Fungal ITS1 community analyses from paired burned/unburned sites across Utah. Sites were selected to have similar environmental characteristics but divergent "time since burn." These samples represent a 20 chrono-sequence of soil fungi, each site with its own unburned control. The goal of this study is to measure the time needed for recovery of soil fungal communities to their unburned state in an alpine forest ecosystem and to address how climate change may impact recovery rates of soil fungi after burns.
